# Psych Crimson - Source
Psych Crimson is a **Template Engine** ran on a fork of Psych Engine (0.6.3/Legacy). An Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. 

Crimson's mission aim is to be an easier alternative to Source code development by providing the essentials only, to have the game running, while also providing quality of life improvements for the user.

This does things such as
- Vanilla weeks + contents from said weeks (such as code and assets)
- No mod folder functionality, while manintaning COMPLETE Lua capabilities (as it's source focused)
- AND MORE TO COME!!!

# The goals
For this engine, the goal is to implement and change a few things to improve the experience:

- better crash prevention + handler
- stage editor
- better caching system (automatic caching rather than the current manual one)
- improved category select (in week editor you'll be able to select either which songs or weeks you want to have in those categories) 
- general optimization
- crimson UI
- bug fixes (ofc) 
- chart editor improvements
